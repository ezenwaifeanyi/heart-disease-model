# heart-disease-model

This machine learning model or algorithm predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not

This is a supervised machine learning (binary) problem with a dataset of patient with and without heat disease. 
A model was designed to help predict the label(target) using the features  on the dataset. with an score = 0.8852459016393442



 * Create a machine learning algorithm/model from heart disease
 * Predict heart disease using machine learning model 
 * workflow to slove a supervised, binary machine learning problem 
 * machine lerning model 
 * machine learning algorithm 
 * supervised learnnig 
 * classification model 

Download the data heart-disease.csv file and saved to same directory as the jupyter file 
model is saved in both pikel and joblis file format
